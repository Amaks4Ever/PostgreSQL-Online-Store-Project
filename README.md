# PostgreSQL Online Store Project

This repository contains a comprehensive PostgreSQL-based project simulating an online store, designed to demonstrate and practice key SQL and database administration skills.

The project covers the full lifecycle of a relational database system, including the modeling of core business entities such as:

- Users
- Products
- Orders
- Order Items

It includes advanced features that go beyond basic SQL queries to showcase real-world data handling, optimization, and security techniques.

## Key Features

### Data Modeling and Structure
- Creation of normalized tables using 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF principles
- Relationships: one-to-many and many-to-many
- Views for simplified access to complex data

### Business Logic Implementation
- Stored Procedures and Functions for reusable business logic
- Triggers to automate actions such as logging or consistency checks

### Security and Access Control
- User roles and privileges management
- Implementation of Row-Level Security (RLS) to isolate user data
- Field-level encryption using pgcrypto for sensitive information (e.g., passwords)

### Optimization and Performance
- Indexing strategies
- Query performance measurement
- Use of EXPLAIN and ANALYZE
- Window functions and CTEs for efficient analytics

### Practical SQL Querying
- Basic and advanced SQL queries
- Aggregations, joins, subqueries, and recursive queries
- Use of CASE, filters, and conditional logic

## Project Structure

### 0_create_and_insert/
Scripts to create tables and populate them with sample data. This is the foundation used for most queries in this portfolio.

### 1_basic_queries/
Basic SELECT, filtering, sorting, and subqueries to handle simple data retrieval.

### 2_aggregations_and_window_functions/
Covers:
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
- Window functions (RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), LAG(), etc.)

### 3_views_and_ctes/
Includes:
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Recursive queries
- Creation and use of VIEW for simplifying query logic

### 4_triggers_and_procedures/
Advanced logic using:
- Triggers for automatic data handling
- Stored procedures and functions

### 5_optimization/
Covers:
- Query optimization
- Execution plans
- Performance best practices

### 6_security/
Includes:
- Basic encryption using pgcrypto
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to restrict access

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean and efficient SQL queries
- Using advanced SQL features (CTEs, Window functions, Triggers, etc.)
- Implementing database-level access control (RLS)
- Automating processes with procedures and triggers
- Performance tuning and optimization techniques

## About

I'm learning SQL to become a Database Administrator and eventually specialize in Database Security. This portfolio is the result of self-study and practical tasks I designed to strengthen my understanding.
